# assignment5

The purpose of this assignment is to practice making UNIX I/O system calls in C.

In a multiplexed manner, your main process will 
read from multiple files, and 
read from the standard input (the terminal).

Create five pipes and spawn five child processes.
Connect a pipe to each child process.
Each child process should write to its pipe.
The parent process should read from all the pipes.
Each of the first four child processes should generate time stamped messages to the nearest 1000th of a second (time starts at 0):  0:00.123: Child 1 message 1  0:02.456: Child 1 message 2  etc.and write the messages one at a time to its pipe.

Sleep for a random time of 0, 1, or 2 seconds between messages.
Terminate the process after 30 seconds.
Meanwhile, the fifth child process should repeatedly prompt at the terminal (standard out) and read one line of input (standard in) typed by the user.

Write the message (with time stamp) to its pipe.
Immediately prompt for the next message.
Terminate the process after 30 seconds.
After spawning the child processes, the parent process should repeatedly read lines from the pipes.

Use the select() system call to determine whether any of the pipes has any input.
Write the lines to an output file output.txt in the order that they were read.

Prepend each line with a time stamp to the nearest 1000th of a second.

Therefore, each line with have two time stamps.
The first time stamp from the parent process.
Followed by the child processâ€™s time stamp.
File output.txt will contain a mixture of lines from the child processes.

Terminate the main process after all thechild processes have terminated.
